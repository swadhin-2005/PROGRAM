            Roseanne Park (born 11 February 1997), known mononymously as Rosé (Korean: 로제), is a New Zealand and South Korean singer[1] and songwriter. Born in Auckland, New Zealand, and raised in Melbourne, Australia,[4] Rosé moved to Seoul, South Korea and signed with label YG Entertainment following a successful audition in Sydney in 2012 and trained for four years before debuting as a member of the South Korean girl group Blackpink in August 2016.

In March 2021, Rosé released her debut single album R, which sold 448,089 copies in its first week, the highest figure by a Korean female soloist. Its lead single "On the Ground" made her the first artist to top the Billboard Global 200 as a soloist and as part of a group, the first Korean female soloist to enter the UK Singles Chart, and the Korean solo artist with the most-viewed music video in the first 24 hours on YouTube. She signed with The Black Label and Atlantic Records in 2024 and released the Billboard Global 200 number-one hit "Apt." with Bruno Mars as the lead single from her debut studio album Rosie (2024). "Apt." topped charts in numerous countries worldwide including South Korea's Circle Digital Chart and Australia's ARIA Singles Chart, where it became the first song by a Korean female soloist to reach the summit. In the US and UK, Rosé earned the first song by a Korean female soloist to enter the top three with "Apt." and the highest-charting album by a Korean female soloist with Rosie.

Rosé has received several accolades throughout her career, including six Guinness World Records, two MAMA Awards, and the Asia Artist Award for Song of the Year. She is the second-most followed Korean individual on Instagram and has appeared on Time's 2025 list of the 100 most influential people in the world as well as Rolling Stone's 2023 list of living icons from Australia and New Zealand.

Life and career
1997–2012: Early life
Roseanne Park, Korean name Park Chae-young (박채영), was born on 11 February 1997[5][6] in Auckland, New Zealand to South Korean immigrant parents,[7] and has an older sister.[8] In 2004, at the age of seven, Rosé and her family moved to Melbourne, Australia.[9] She began singing and learned to play guitar and piano as a child and performed in church choirs.[9][10] She attended Kew East Primary School in Kew East[3] and Canterbury Girls' Secondary College in Canterbury, Victoria, a Melbourne suburb, but dropped out before year 11, after signing with South Korean record label YG Entertainment.[11]

2012–2015: Pre-debut
In 2012, Rosé attended an audition in Sydney for YG Entertainment, a South Korean company whose music she already liked.[12] She went at her father's suggestion[9] and came in first among the 700 participants.[13][14] She had initially presumed her father's idea was a joke due to the distance and difficulty of becoming a singer overseas saying that "she didn't think that there was much of a chance to become a K-pop star [herself]."[9] Two months later, she had signed with the label as a trainee, and moved to Seoul, South Korea.[11]

In the same year, Rosé was featured on labelmate G-Dragon's song "Without You" from his extended play (EP) One of a Kind (2012). Her name was not publicised at the time of release, her credit was revealed only following her announcement as a member of Blackpink.[15] The song peaked at number ten on South Korea's Gaon Music Chart and at number 15 on the Billboard Korea K-pop Hot 100.[16][17]

            A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica. It originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.[1][2] M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".[1][2] Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.[3]

Worldwide, there are several hundred cultivars of mango. Depending on the cultivar, mango fruit varies in size, shape, sweetness, skin color, and flesh color, which may be pale yellow, gold, green, or orange.[4] Mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan and the Philippines,[5][6] while the mango tree is the national tree of Bangladesh.[7]

Etymology
The English word mango (plural mangoes or mangos) originated in the 16th century from the Portuguese word manga, from the Malay mangga, and ultimately from the Tamil mā (மா, 'mango tree') + kāy (ங்காய், 'unripe fruit/vegetable')[8][9][10] or the Malayalam māṅṅa (മാവ്, 'mango tree') + kāya (കായ, 'unripe fruit').[11] The

            Justin Drew Bieber (/ˈbiːbər/ BEE-bər; born March 1, 1994)[1][2] is a Canadian singer and songwriter. Regarded as a pop icon, he is known for his multi-genre musical performances.[3][4] He was discovered by Scooter Braun in 2008 and brought to the U.S. by Usher, both of whom formed RBMG Records to sign Bieber in October of that year. His debut extended play, My World (2009), was met with international recognition and established him as a teen idol.

Bieber rose to mainstream fame with his debut album, My World 2.0 (2010), which topped the US Billboard 200 — making him the youngest solo male to do so in 47 years.[5] Its lead single, "Baby" (featuring Ludacris), became one of the best selling singles in the U.S.[6] His second album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut atop chart.[7] Bieber explored dance-pop on his third album, Believe (2012); its acoustic re-release made him the first artist in Billboard history to have five US number-one albums by the age of 18.[8]

Bieber explored EDM with his 2015 single "Where Are Ü Now", which won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording.[9][10] This influenced his fourth album, Purpose (2015), which yielded the singles "Love Yourself", "Sorry", and "What Do You Mean?" — all three peaked the Billboard Hot 100, and simultaneously entered the top three spots on the UK singles chart — making him the first musical act to do so in the chart's history. Two of his 2017 guest appearances — on DJ Khaled's "I'm the One" and Luis Fonsi's "Despacito" — peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100, making him the first artist to replace himself atop chart with different songs in two consecutive weeks;[11] the latter won him a Latin Grammy Award.

His fifth and sixth albums, Changes (2020) and Justice (2021), both topped the Billboard 200; the latter included his seventh US-number one single "Peaches" and made him break Elvis Presley's 1965 record for the youngest solo act to have eight US number-one albums. Also in 2021, he released his eighth US number-one single, "Stay" (with the Kid Laroi). Bieber's seventh album, Swag (2025), explored a contemporary R&B soundscape.

Bieber is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with over 150 million units sold worldwide and five diamond certifications from the RIAA.[12] His accolades include two Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, eight Juno Awards, two Brit Awards, 26 Billboard Music Awards, 18 American Music Awards, and 22 MTV Europe Music Awards (the most wins for any artist). Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and Forbes' listed him among the top ten most powerful celebrities from 2011 to 2013.[13] Billboard ranked him the eighth-greatest pop star of the 21st century.

Early life
Justin Drew Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario,[14] and was raised in Stratford.[15] His parents Jeremy Jack Bieber and Pattie Mallette were both 18 when Bieber was born and split up not long after his birth.[16] Pattie worked a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing. Mallette's mother Diane and stepfather Bruce helped her raise Bieber.[17] Bieber has maintained contact with his father.[18] Bieber's ancestry includes French, Irish, English, Scottish and German.[19][20][21]

Bieber has three younger half-siblings; the four have the same father, Jeremy Bieber. Jeremy Bieber and his ex-girlfriend, Erin Wagner,[22] who broke up in 2014 after seven years together, have two children, daughter Jazmyn and son Jaxon.[23] Jeremy married his girlfriend Chelsey in February 2018, and they have a daughter named Bay.[24][25] Bieber also has a stepsister named Allie, the daughter of his stepmother.[26] Bieber attended two French-language immersion elementary schools in Stratford, Jeanne Sauvé Catholic School[17] and Bedford Public School. In grades 7 and 8, he attended Stratford Northwestern. Former teacher, Kim Booker often recalled fond memories of Bieber as her student, and is featured in several interviews. He attended Stratford's St. Michael Catholic Secondary School, and graduated in 2012[27] with a 4.0 GPA.[28]

Growing up, he learned to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet.[15][29] In early 2007, aged 12, Bieber performed Ne-Yo's "So Sick" for a local singing competition in Stratford, in which he placed second.[29][30] Mallette posted a video of the performance on YouTube for their family and friends to see. She continued to upload videos of Bieber singing covers of various R&B songs, and Bieber's popularity on the site grew.[31] In the same year, Bieber busked shows in front of the Avon Theatre steps with a rented guitar during tourism season.[32]

            Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg (Swedish: [ˈɡrêːta ˈtʉ̂ːnbærj] ⓘ; born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish climate and political activist initially known for challenging world leaders to take immediate action to mitigate the effects of climate change.[1][2][3][4]

Born in Stockholm, Thunberg's climate activism began when she persuaded her parents to adopt lifestyle choices that reduced her family's carbon footprint. In August 2018, aged 15, Thunberg began skipping school, vowing to remain out of school until after a Swedish election to attempt to influence the outcome. She protested outside the Swedish parliament where she called for stronger action on climate change by holding up a Skolstrejk för klimatet (School Strike for Climate) sign and handing out informational flyers.[5] After the election, Thunberg spoke in front of supporters, telling them to use phones to film her. She then said she would continue school striking for the climate every Friday until Sweden was in compliance with the Paris climate agreement.[6] Thunberg's youth and blunt speaking manner fueled her rise to the status of a global icon.[7]

After Thunberg's first school strike for the climate, other students engaged in similar protests. They united and organized the school strike for climate movement. After Thunberg addressed the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference, weekly climate strike protests took place on Fridays around the world. In 2019, coordinated multi-city protests involved over a million students each.[8] To avoid carbon-intensive flying, Thunberg sailed on a carbon-free yacht from England to New York where she addressed the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit.[9] In her speech, Thunberg scolded the world's leaders by exclaiming "How dare you" in reference to their perceived indifference and inaction to the climate crisis. Her admonishment made worldwide headlines.[10]

After Thunberg graduated from high school in 2023, her activism continued to gain international attention and her protest tactics have become increasingly assertive.[11] As an adult, her protests have included both peaceful demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience such as defying lawful orders to disperse, which have led to arrests, convictions, and an acquittal.[12][13] Thunberg's activism has evolved to include other causes, supporting Ukraine,[2] Palestine,[14] Armenia[15] and Western Sahara[16] in their respective conflicts with Russia, Israel, Azerbaijan and Morocco. Thunberg's rise to world fame made her an ad hoc leader in the climate activist community.[17] She faced heavy criticism, especially due to her age.[18] Thunberg's influence on the world stage has been described by The Guardian and other media as the "Greta effect".[19] She has received honours and awards, including in Time's 100 most influential people, named the youngest Time Person of the Year in 2019, inclusion in the Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women (2019),[20] and nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize.[21][22][23]

Early life
Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg[24][25] was born on 3 January 2003, in Stockholm, Sweden,[26][27] to opera singer Malena Ernman and actor Svante Thunberg.[28][29] Her paternal grandfather was actor and director Olof Thunberg.[30][31][32] As explained by The Week, "with a thespian father" and singer mother, "it is perhaps unsurprising that [Thunberg] has a slightly unusual name.... Thunberg shares her second name with the adventuring creation of Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, better known as Hergé."[33] She has a younger sister, Beata.[29]

Thunberg says she first heard about climate change in 2011, when she was eight years old, and could not understand why so little was being done about it.[34][29] The situation depressed her, and as a result, at the age of 11, she largely stopped talking, severely restricted her eating, and lost ten kilograms (22 lb) in two months.[35] Eventually, she was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and selective mutism.[34][29] In one of her first speeches demanding climate action, Thunberg described her selective mutism as meaning she "only speaks when necessary".[34] She struggled with depression for almost four years before she began her school strike campaign.[36] When she started protesting, her parents did not support her activism. Her father said he did not like her missing school but added: "[We] respect that she wants to make a stand. She can either sit at home and be really unhappy, or protest and be happy."[37]

From her TEDx Talk
I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, OCD and selective mutism. That basically means I only speak when I think it's necessary. Now is one of those moments.

Greta Thunberg, Stockholm[38]
November 2018
Thunberg's diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome was made public nationwide in Sweden by her mother in May 2015, in order to help families in similar situations.[39] While acknowledging that her diagnosis "has limited [her] before", Thunberg does not view her Asperger's as an illness, and has instead called it her "superpower".[40] She was later described as not only the best-known climate change activist, but also the best-known autism rights activist.[41] In 2021, Thunberg said that many people in the Fridays for Future movement are autistic, and very inclusive and welcoming. She thinks that the reason so many autistic people become climate activists is that they cannot look away, and have to tell the truth as they see it: "I know lots of people who have been depressed, and then they have joined the climate movement or Fridays for Future and have found a purpose in life and found friendship and a community that they are welcome in." She considers the best things that have resulted from her activism to be friendships and happiness.[41]

For about two years, Thunberg challenged her parents to lower the family's carbon footprint and overall impact on the environment by becoming vegan, upcycling, and giving up flying.[28][42][43] She has said she showed them graphs and data, but when that did not work, she warned her family that they were stealing her future.[44] Giving up flying in part meant her mother had to abandon international ventures in her opera career.[37] Interviewed in December 2019 by the BBC, her father said: "To be honest, [her mother] didn't do it to save the climate. She did it to save her child, because she saw how much it meant to her, and then, when she did that, she saw how much [Greta] grew from that, how much energy she got from it."[45] Thunberg credits her parents' eventual response and lifestyle changes with giving her hope and belief that she could make a difference.[28] Asked in September 2021 whether she felt guilty about ending her mother's international career, she was surprised by the question: "It was her choice. I didn't make her do anything. I just provided her with the information to base her decision on."[41] The family's story is recounted in the 2018 book Scenes from the Heart,[46] updated in 2020 as Our House Is on Fire: Scenes of a Family and a Planet in Crisis, with contributions from the girls, and the whole family credited as authors.[41][47]
